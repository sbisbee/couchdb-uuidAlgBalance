Usage
-----

node ./main.js [number of consumers]

Example: node ./main.js 3

The General Idea
----------------

Let's say you have a bunch of consumers polling a changes feed. You want to
divide the work between the consumers evenly, so you decide to base it on the
documents' _id since they are just big hexidecimal numbers.


Flow
----

  - Take in the results of /_uuids (from a file)
  - Grab the last 4 characters of each id
  - Converts that hex number to decimal
  - Take the remainder of that decimal number divided by the number of nodes
  - Output distribution
